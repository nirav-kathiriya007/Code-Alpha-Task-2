## 📊 Project Description
The dataset was fully preprocessed using Python, including **handling missing values, cleaning, and transforming data** for analysis. Various visualizations were created to extract meaningful insights:  

- **Bar chart:** Showed **region-wise Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)**  
- **Bar chart:** Highlighted the **top 5 regions with the highest unemployment rate**  
- **Pie chart:** Displayed **unemployment distribution by Area (Rural vs Urban)**  
- **Line chart:** Tracked **monthly unemployment rate trends**  
- **Area-wise line chart:** Showed **monthly unemployment rate trends by Rural and Urban areas**  

These visualizations help identify patterns in unemployment and support **data-driven policy and decision-making**.
